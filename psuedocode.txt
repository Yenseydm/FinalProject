IDEA

an app that allows users to contribute meals to those in need in their community

users post what they can contribute in meal #s, and add to a specific day 

posters tell us whether they will need pick up for their contributions or whether they can drop off

we take meals for the day to the local food bank



NOTES

what kind of foods can be contributed? think of foods that can spoil


CRUD 

GET webpage data to display

POST allows users to input what meals they can contribute to what day



PUT shows how many meals will be available each day (week by week calendar?)

Allow users to EDIT and DELETE their entries
